In this licence, the term "Songlark Toolchain" or simply "Toolchain" refers to
all software, documentation and other artefacts in this repository, as well as
any object or binary forms generated by transforming the Toolchain itself.
Except for the example programs in this repository, the term "Toolchain" does
not include user programs that refer to the Toolchain as a library, nor does it
include any code generated by executing the Toolchain on a user program.
However, any non-commercial restrictions apply transitively to the generated
code, so that using the generated code in a forbidden context is considered to
be using the Songlark Toolchain in a forbidden context.

Songlark Automata grants you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable,
royalty-free licence to access, use and modify the Songlark Toolchain for your
own internal, non-commercial purposes. You may also share or distribute copies
of the Toolchain, parts of the Toolchain, or derivative works, subject to the
above non-commercial restrictions.

Academic research, education and evaluation to check fit-for-purpose are all
valid non-commercial uses of the toolchain, even when such an evaluation is
performed within the context of a commercial enterprise.

This licence forbids the use of the Toolchain for commercial purposes including
licensing, selling or leasing the Toolchain; distributing or re-distributing
the Toolchain for commercial purposes; using the software to create commercial
products; or using the software to perform business functions or otherwise
procure commercial gain.

Users wishing to use the Toolchain for commercial purposes should contact the
copyright holder, Songlark Automata, for a commercial licence.
